We'd be working on enormous numbers, straining the machines resources
- even though Scheme's bignum system is awesome.

For example, for testing the primality of 1000037 ~= 1M,
if the random number generator gives us a test number also around 1M,
We'd be calculating 1M ^ 1M, meaning a number with 6M decimal digits.
