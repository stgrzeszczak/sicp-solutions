My solutions for the problems from Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs 2nd ed. textbook by H. Abelson & G.J. Sussman.

Ongoing effort.

Tested using Chez Scheme 10.0.0.

Much of the code is taken directly from the book, so you should look at its license before copying anything.

The first half of solutions for chapter 1 is missing and will not be re-created.
