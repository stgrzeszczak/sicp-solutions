Assuming two positive numbers, 1 & 2, defined by Center C and Tolerance T given as a fraction (without need to multiply/divide by 100 for percents)

Let R be the result of multiplying 1 & 2.

upper bound of R = C1*(1 + T1) * C2*(1 + T2) = C1*C2 + C1*C2*(T1 + T2) + C1*C2*T1*T2
lower bound of R = C1*(1 - T1) * C2*(1 - T2) = C1*C2 - C1*C2*(T1 + T2) + C1*C2*T1*T2

Assuming that the tolerances are small, we can cross out the last terms, and approximate
TR = T1 + T2.
