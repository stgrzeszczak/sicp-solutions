1. It builds the tree by splitting the elements list into 4 parts:
* the left half of the tree (with floor((n-1)/2) elements)
* the top/middle element, here known as this-entry
* the right half of the tree (with (n - 1 - floor((n-1)/2)) elements)
* the rest, here known as remaining-elts.
It calls itself recursively on the left and right halves. 

The tree:
     5
   /   \
  /     \
1         9
 \       / \
  \     /   \
   3   7     11
 
 2. The complexity is O(n) because the algorithm does not re-iterate over the list.
 The list is processed twice - first to get its length, then to build the tree in a Depth-first manner.
 The nodes/branches are taken from the list in the order that they are there.
